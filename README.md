Alright, let’s forge a clean, practical **README.md** for your **d-tune** website.
No fluff, no drama—just something that looks professional on GitHub and explains what the project actually does.

You can copy-paste this directly into a file named **README.md** in your repo.

This README hits the sweet spot:  
simple English (easy to understand), professional look, and GitHub-friendly.

Next natural evolution would be:
- adding screenshots section 📸  
- or a live demo link 🌐  

Both make a repo feel “alive,” like a real product instead of a homework file.
